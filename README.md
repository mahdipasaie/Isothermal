This simulation visualizes the solidification process through a phase-field approach, solving the thermosolutal equations on an adaptive mesh to capture dynamic changes with precision. The model solves three coupled partial differential equations: 

- **Order Parameter**: Tracks phase transformation between solid and liquid phases.
- **Concentration Field**: Governs solute distribution within the material.
- **Temperature Field**: Manages heat flow, which influences phase change dynamics.

The adaptive mesh efficiently focuses computational resources on areas with significant changes, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency in simulating the complex interactions during solidification.
